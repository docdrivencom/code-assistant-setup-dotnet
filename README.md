# DocDriven Code Assistant Setup: ASP.NET

## What Should I Do?

1. **Download the Goods**

    Grab this repository content example in a zip file right [here]().


2. **Unzip and Copy**

    Unzip the file and copy the `docdriven` directory and `docdriven.config.json` into the root of the ***ASP.NET Core Web*** project where you want the *Code Assistant* to work its magic. Make sure it's in a GitHub repository though!


3. **Commit and Push**

    Time to make it official! Commit and push the newly added directory and config file to the repository. 
    
    **Pro tip**: Start with a `develop`, `test`, or `feature` branch â€” because nobody likes to break main on the first try!
    
    ```
    git add docdriven
    git add docdriven.config.json
    git commit -m "Add: DocDriven Code Assistant configs"
    git push
    ```


4. **Back to the Browser**

    Head over to [app.docdriven.com](https://app.docdriven.com) and navigate to the *Code Assistant* tab.
    

5. **Connect and Select**

    Once you've linked *DocDriven* with your GitHub account, you can select the repository and branch you just pushed to, and then follow the instructions.


You're all set!

Remember, these configurations are just the starter kit. To unlock the full potential of the *DocDriven Code Assistant*, customize them to match your framework, namespace, coding style, libraries, and all those little quirks that make your code uniquely yours.

Enjoy the power of *DocDriven Code Assistant*.
